# Unsupervised-ML-AIS-Data
Unsupervised machine learning application to AIS (ship GPS) data. My solution can be improved by correctly implementing a custom built algorithm which I described generically in the paper. I couldn't completely solve all the caveats in the time frame, so I shifted towards implementing a pre-packaged unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

Case Study2.pdf is the paper which includes the analysis and a solution to the problem.

Inside the Code/Algorithm Testing/HTML you can find multiple plots of the data on on Google Maps. This is useful, since it lets us better understand the topography of our feature space. This allows us to deduce harbors and easily understand frequent sea lanes/ sea routes better.
